Missing surgical instruments at the time of checking in a tray at a hospital's
SPD means that a surgery is delayed at best, or it has to be canceled at
worst.

Missing instruments at the time of returning specialty/loaner trays to your
distribution center means that hundreds, if not thousands of dollars are lost.

Our state-of-the-art computer vision models accurately and seamlessly classify
the surgical instruments in the tray with one top-down camera.

If the instruments in your trays are very similar to each other, you might want
to check out our computer vision + manipulation solution for tray
validation. Click here to learn more about how we integrate our computer vision
software with robotic arms to increase the classification accuracy by
manipulating each individual instrument.
